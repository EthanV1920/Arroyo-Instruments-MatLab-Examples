# TEC Utility

1. List of COM Ports

2. Simple changing of set point and turning on
    - Change the temperature
    - Turn output on

3. Logging of data
    - Log and graph data over a user-defined amount of time
    - User-defined log interval (1 Hz by default)
    - Log all dynamic values

4. Changing of set point and logging of data until stable
    - User selected tol time and tol temp

    - User-defined log interval (1 Hz by default)

    - Change set point and turn output on

    - Log all dynamic values

    - Log data until stable.

5. Temperature ramp (# points, record current and voltage once stable)
    - User selected start, stop, and step sizes

    - User selected tol time and tol temp

    - User-defined log interval (1 Hz by default)

    - Log all dynamic values

    - Log data until stable.

    - Calculate Rtec? TEC power?

# Laser Utility

1. Simple changing of set point and turning on (current mode)
    - Change the current set point

    - Turn output on

2. Logging of data
    - Log and graph data over a user-defined amount of time

    - User-defined log interval (1 Hz by default)

    - Log all dynamic values

3. LVI curve (current ramp)
    - User selected start, stop, and step sizes

    - User selected dwell time at each point

    - Log all dynamic values

    - Calculate threshold? Slope efficiency?

For each test, if possible, display the current values and have the ability to stop the test.
